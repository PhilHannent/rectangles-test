#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    /*
     * Rectangles
     *
     * The task is as follows:
     *
     * 1. create a class to represent a rectangle. A rectangle has x, y, width and height values.
     *
     * 2. create a function which takes as input a collection of rectangles, and returns the
     *    sum of the areas of all the rectangles in the collection.
     *
     * 3. create a function which takes as input a collection of rectangles and returns the
     *    a rectangle within which all the rectangles in the input collection fit tightly
     *    (the bounding rectangle)
     *
     * You are welcome to use any standard libraries, functions or features which
     * are included in the c++11 standard, as long as the requirements of the task are met.
     * You are also allowed to use Qt classes if you are
     * already familiar with the Qt API's (with some exceptions listed below). The choice of what
     * to use to satisfy the "collection' requirement is also up to you. We do not mind the entire implementation
     * being contained within this main.cpp file, or if you split it up into multiple files.
     *
     * To demonstrate the code is working, create a collection of example rectangles (2 or 3
     * rectangles is enough) and print the result of the two functions on the console output
     *
     * Please feel free to ask questions if any of the above is unclear or if there
     * is anything which you would like clarifying.
     *
     * The following classes must NOT be used:
     *
     * QRect, QRectF
